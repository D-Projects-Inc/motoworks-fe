## 1. Overview of the Field

### A. Motorcycle Mechanics:

- Focus on maintenance, repair, and customization of motorcycles.
- Involves understanding engines (2-stroke, 4-stroke), transmissions, suspensions, electrical systems, brakes, and fuel systems.
- Services often include routine servicing (oil change, chain adjustment), diagnostics, performance tuning, and accident repair.

----

### B. Generator Mechanics:

- Focus on small gas-powered and diesel generators.
- Involves maintenance and repair of engines, fuel systems, alternators, and control panels.
- Services include troubleshooting starting problems, electrical faults, fuel issues, and load testing.

----

### Overlap:

- Both require **engine mechanics knowledge, diagnostics, electrical systems understanding, and safety practices.**
- Many small workshops service both motorcycles and small generators, especially in South Africa, where backup generators are common.

## 2. Technical Knowledge Areas

### A. Engines

####  Motorcycles:

- **Types**: Single-cylinder, parallel-twin, V-twin, inline-four, etc.
- **Engines**: 2-stroke (lightweight, high rev) vs 4-stroke (more fuel efficient, durable).
- **Key Maintenance**: oil changes, valve adjustments, timing chain/belt checks, spark plug replacement.

----

#### Generators:

- Single-cylinder or multi-cylinder small engines.
- **Maintenance**: Oil changes, air/fuel filter cleaning, carburetor tuning, spark plug maintenance.

----

### B. Fuel Systems

- **Motorcycles**: Carbureted vs fuel-injected systems.
- **Generators**: Mostly carbureted; some newer models are EFI (Electronic Fuel Injection).
- Knowledge of fuel quality, ethanol content, and storage is critical.

----

### C. Electrical Systems

- Batteries, alternators, ignition systems, starters, lighting circuits.
- **For Generators**: Voltage regulators, circuit breakers, and wiring harness troubleshooting.

----

### D. Transmission & Drivetrain

- **Motorcycles**: Manual gearboxes, chain/belt drives, clutch systems.
- **Generators**: Not applicable, but understanding load output and efficiency is key.

----

### E. Diagnostics Tools

- Multimeters (voltage, current, resistance).
- Compression testers (for engine health).
- Timing lights, fuel pressure testers, load banks (for generators).

----

### F. Safety

- Protective equipment: gloves, goggles, hearing protection.
- Fuel handling safety (flammable liquids).
- Electrical safety for generator servicing.
