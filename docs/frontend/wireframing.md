  How to Display These in MotoWorks

  If you're building a customer-facing app, website, or service menu in MotoWorks, here are some ideas on how to present these add-ons to maximize uptake:

  Service Package Tiering

  Create “Bronze / Silver / Gold” packages (or something similar) — each tier includes more add-ons (e.g., Gold = full tune-up + detailing + safety inspection).

  Add-On Checkbox / Selector During Booking

  When a customer is making a service appointment, show a list of optional add-ons (with brief descriptions and prices). Let them tick the ones they want.

  Bundle Discounts

  Offer discounts when customers pick multiple add-ons (e.g., “add both detailing + chain lube = 10% off”).

  Subscription / Maintenance Plan Page

  Build a “Plans” section: show different maintenance plans (monthly / yearly) with what’s included (services, roadside support, pick-up, etc).

  Loyalty Program Dashboard

  Let customers see their loyalty points, history of services, and how close they are to next reward / free add-on.

  Promotional Pop-Ups / Campaigns

  Run campaigns like “Free safety check with every 3rd service” or “First-time detailing at 50% off”.

  Educational Content / Blog / Tips Section

  Implement a blog or “tips” section in the app: maintenance tips, how to check chain tension, seasonal advice, etc.

  Feedback & Upsell After Service

  After service is done, send a follow-up message / email: “Your bike was due for chain lube next time – book it now and get 5% off.” This helps upsell for next time.

  Online Booking & Payment

  Provide a booking interface where add-ons are clearly listed. Also integrate payment so customers can pay for add-ons upfront.

  Why These Work (Business Case)

  Higher Ticket Value: Add-ons increase the average invoice without dramatically increasing labor cost (e.g., diagnostics or inspections).

  Customer Retention: Plans, loyalty programs, and consistent communication build long-term customers. 
  FasterCapital

  Convenience as a Differentiator: Pick-up/drop-off and mobile services make it easy for customers, giving your shop a competitive edge. 
  FasterCapital
  +1

  Trust & Transparency: Offering free check-ups and clearly listing what add-ons are optional (vs mandatory) helps with trust. (Also relevant to competition / consumer regulation).

  Recurring Revenue: Maintenance plans / service plans mean more predictable income and potentially better cash flow.

  Got you, G!
  Here are the best 8 high-margin, high-impact Value-Added Add-Ons that will work especially well for a South African motorcycle workshop like MotoWorks (including small engines like generators).
  These are selected for:
  ✔ Profitability
  ✔ Practical value to customers
  ✔ Very low cost to execute
  ✔ Easy to integrate into your MotoWorks app

  🚀 Top 8 Value-Added Add-Ons for MotoWorks
  1. “RideSafe” Full Safety Check (Free or R49)

  What it includes:

  Brake pad condition check

  Chain & sprocket wear

  Tyre pressure & tread

  Lights, indicators, horn

  Fluid levels

  Basic bolt tightening

  Why it works:
  This builds trust and lets you identify upsell opportunities organically without sounding salesy.

  2. Pick-Up & Drop-Off Service (R99 – R249 depending on distance)

  Customers LOVE convenience. Perfect for:

  Students

  Workers in town

  Riders whose bike won’t start

  Rainy weather days

  Bonus: You can integrate geo-pricing in your app later.

  3. Mobile Mechanic Call-Out (From R250 + labour)

  You go to the customer’s home or work.
  Great for small repairs:

  Battery replacement

  Plug change

  Puncture repair

  Fuel line/bore issues

  Why it works:
  High-margin. You charge for convenience and travel.

  4. Chain Clean + Lube Package (R120 – R180)

  Value:

  Takes 5–10 minutes

  Huge difference in ride quality and chain life

  Super popular with delivery bikers

  Use in your app:
  Over 70% of bike riders will tick this add-on if the price is right.

  5. Full Bike Wash + Detail (R80–R250)

  Options:

  Basic wash

  Premium wash with polish

  Engine degreasing

  Chrome revive

  Why it works:
  People LOVE leaving with a clean bike. Easy upsell.

  6. Express Diagnostics (R150 – R300)

  A 15-minute digital or manual test to quickly identify:

  Electrical faults

  Injector/carburettor issues

  Battery health

  Engine codes (if applicable)

  Why it works:
  Upsell leads directly to paid repairs.

  7. “Service Saver” Maintenance Plan (Monthly Subscription)

  Example:
  R149/month
  Includes:

  1 basic service per quarter

  Free safety checks anytime

  10% off repairs

  Priority booking

  Why it works:
  Recurring cash flow + customer retention.

  8. Helmet & Gear Cleaning (R50 – R120)

  Includes:

  Helmet sanitizing

  Visor polish

  Jacket wipe-down

  Gloves deodorized

  Why it works:
  Nobody likes washing gear.
  Easy service, high markup.

  🌍 South African Flavour Add-Ons

  If you want extra-local options, these also hit home:

  9. “Taxi-Style Emergency Rescue” Call-Out

  Similar to roadside assist—but for bikes.

  10. Delivery Rider Loyalty Add-On

  R20 discount per service

  Free chain checks

  “Pay at month-end” option

  Delivery riders are a HUGE and loyal market.

  11. Generator Wellness Check

  Perfect for load-shedding season:

  Oil

  Spark plug

  Air filter

  Voltage output test

    Section: Origin Story / Introduction

    Header:
    “Born in a Backyard. Built on Grit.”

    Text:
    “MotoWorks started as a small weekend hustle — fixing neighbours’ scooters, delivering generators during load-shedding, and helping riders stuck on the side of the road.
    Today, it’s a fully equipped workshop serving motorcyclists, households, and small businesses across the community.

    What hasn’t changed is the heart behind the tools: honesty, fair pricing, and repairs that actually last.”

    Section: The Mechanic (Profile Highlight)

    Header:
    “Meet the Mechanic: A Rider, a Tinkerer, and a Problem-Solver.”

    Text:
    “Behind MotoWorks is a mechanic who grew up around engines — stripping carburettors before most kids learned long division.
    With hands-on experience across motorbikes, generators, lawnmowers and small engines, he blends practical skill with a love for machinery.
    Whether it’s a vintage rebuild, a commuter service, or a generator that won’t start, every job gets the same attention to detail.”

    Optional Sub-points (icons recommended):

    Over 10 years engine repair experience

    Field-service ready (we come to you)

    Honest quoting — no surprise costs

    Passion for performance & reliability

    4. Open Communication

    Everything needed to get your machine running at its absolute best.”
